"""
API endpoint tests for the MCP Waifu Chat Server.

This module contains tests for all the MCP tools and resources provided by the server:

Test Categories:
- Server status endpoints
- User management tools (create, check, delete, count)
- Dialog management tools (get, set, reset)
- Chat functionality with AI integration
- Error handling and edge cases
- Request/response validation

Note: Some tests are currently marked as non-functional due to FastMCP
testing limitations and will need adaptation for proper mocking or
integration testing approaches.
